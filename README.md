# coding-quizHD

This project was made to test my skills combining Javascript, HTML, and CSS by coding a practice quiz for coding interview prep!

This quiz will prompt the user to begin, and ask them a series of questions regarding basic coding knowledge. This quiz is on a time limit and will penalize the user (10) seconds for each missed question, and will save the users score to a separate webpage in which they will be able to see their improvement over time.
